# Files Description
Here, I have made a model that predicts the wheteher there was an event or not on the specific date using OHLCV values of stocks.
  
### Stock Data-Set:
    1. amd.csv	(default Data-Set)
    2. accdata.csv 	( change the imported data set to “accdata.csv”  to test this )

### Codes:
    1. Data_look.py   : to view how the Stock looks like in actual w.r.t Opening Price.
    2. Event_Pred.py : Prediction of on which dates Event has occurred , each date has been indexed 
       and it is plotted according to that , with a green line showing the limit which decides event has occurred or not.
### Files:
    1. Even_Pred.png:  It is the Graph result which has been obtained from Event_Pred.py and it changes every time you run the code for a particular dataset.
    2. Data_look.png: It is the Graphical Representation of the Input Data-Set.
